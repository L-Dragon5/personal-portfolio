# Personal Website

Tools:
 - SASS (CSS preprocesser)
 - Gatsby (React framework for static sites)
 
Languages:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript (ES6+)
 
It's a single page application that holds information about myself, my various projects that I can talk about, and a way to contact me.
This was my challenge to understand ES6 in a practical way and start using a modern framework, like React.

I want to progress further with this and be able to create front-end displays with React and back-end REST APIs with Drupal or Laravel and create fully decoupled web applications.
