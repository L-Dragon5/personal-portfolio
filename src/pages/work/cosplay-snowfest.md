While I was the President and Webmaster of the RIT Cosplay Troupe back in University, I made a complete overhaul to the website used for the club's signature event, Cosplay Snow Festival. All media and content were created by me.

I installed WordPress and developed reusable plugins to help facilitate further maintenance of the website when I graduated. The theme is a completely custom theme developed with Bootstrap to allow quick responsive development.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, jQuery, WordPress
