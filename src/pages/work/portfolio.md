This website that you're viewing right now.

My old portfolio website was designed with HTML and CSS with the W3.CSS library.

To test my skills and start learning ES6+, I decided to develop a new portfolio website using Gatsby, a framework built upon React.
Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React and JavaScript to create pages. It can also convert Markdown templates into pages, which is what this page is actually built upon.

The code is available on my GitHub below. You can see how things are connected together and how components work.

**Technologies:** Gatsby, SASS
