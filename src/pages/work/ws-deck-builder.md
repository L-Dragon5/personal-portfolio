Website developed for popular Japanese trading card game, Weiss Schwarz.

There was a online deck builder web application called wsdecks that allowed users to prototype new deck ideas before having to purchase any cards. Due to various reasons, the website was shut down and the owner refused to release the existing codebase.

This project was a test to see how quickly I could develop a responsive website using Laravel and Bootstrap and build upon the existing functionality of the original website. The site was never released to the public as it was more of a personal challenge. Anyways, a different site, EncoreDecks, took its place.

**Technologies:** HTML, SASS, jQuery, Laravel
