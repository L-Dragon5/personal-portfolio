This project is a continuation from a previous project called the "Fan Event Schedule".
That project was built on the same technologies, but it was built on React Classes and MaterializeCSS.

There are a lot of event management and scheduling software available for events. Unfortunately, a lot of them are prohibitively expensive for small-scale events with little to no budgets. I developed FES as a SaaS application that allows event organizers to create shareable schedules for their events with an easy-to-use interface. It's free to use and build upon.

**Technologies:** Laravel, React, Material-UI
