Android application that uses an open-source image recognition API to display English translations of popular Japanese trading card game, Weiss Schwarz.

The application started off as a personal project, but later contracted by the North American Distributor of Weiss Schwarz, Heart of the Cards, to convert it into an official application.

It was published on March 2015 with over 5,000 downloads. The mobile application hasn't been updated due to the long process to get approval from the actual card game company, but the back-end database is consistently updated with new set releases.

**Technologies:** Java, PHP, MySQL, Some Unix shell scripts
