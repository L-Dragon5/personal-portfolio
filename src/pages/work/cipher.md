Developed for popular Japanese trading card game, Fire Emblem Cipher.

English translations are available on a fanmade wiki for the game, but it was difficult to navigate, especially while learning the game.

I used PHP to web scrape the wiki of the card images and translations and use the data to create a more easily searchable format for cards and information.

jQuery is used for loading cards, pagination, modals, and live search.

Project is no longer being maintained.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP
