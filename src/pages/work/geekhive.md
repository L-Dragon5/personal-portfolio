Worked at GeekHive during Summer 2017 as a web developer co-op tasked with working with PHP for Wordpress & Drupal.

Most development time was making updates and changes to the main GeekHive website based on the creative team's designs and reports in JIRA.

During my time as a full-time employee, I made further changes to the website including resource pages and a special Digital Maturity Assessment page using a combination of Salesforce and other back-end technologies.

This is an old image of the site as the site has been updated since then.

**Technologies:** HTML, SASS, jQuery, WordPress
