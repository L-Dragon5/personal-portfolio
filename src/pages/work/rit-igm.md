This was my main project while working as a co-op web developer during Summer 2016. We were originally tasked to maintain an old system used by the department's academic advisors, but our team of four was split in half. One team was maintaining and updating the old system while the other team developed a brand new system to manage all the academic labs. I was the lead developer for the new system.

The project was a web interface for RIT's Interactive Games and Media department. It allowed remote access and operations to computer labs, inventory and maintenance, classroom news displays, and managing employees.

By the time my co-op period ended, the project wasn't completely finished due to the large scope. It was never intended to be completed by the end of my period, but it is still being actively worked on by future co-ops.

Website link is not available as it is an internal system that is only accessible on the RIT IGM network.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP
