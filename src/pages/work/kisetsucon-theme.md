Custom wordpress theme developed for use for Kisetsucon, Inc.'s annual Asian pop-culture convention.

As founder and president of Kisetsucon, Inc. We needed a website and to showcase our events and plans. As I do custom Wordpress development, I decided it would be better to create a custom theme for ourselves rather than grab a theme available online. This would give us the most flexibility with the design and functionality.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, PHP

**Frameworks:** WordPress
