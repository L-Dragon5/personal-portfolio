Webite to manage personal listings to purchase on chinese marketplace website, Taobao.

A lot of my friends cosplay - dress up as their favorite characters from anime and video games. Many of them purchase affordable cosplays of popular series from China on Taobao.

This site was created to allow people an easy place to store all the listings they wanted to purchase with some customizability. Rather than having hundreds of web bookmarks or copying links into a Google Doc, this would allow users to view all their listings in one place, with a preview image, custom name, and approximate price.

**Technologies:** HTML, SASS, jQuery, PHP

**Frameworks:** Laravel
