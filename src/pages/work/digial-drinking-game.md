Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I wanted to create a digital version of several popular drinking card games to use with friends when hanging out digitally. Because using physical cards and a webcam would be too tedious and have unintended issues, I built this digital version using only React and hosted on Google Firebase so that anyone can make cards and play with friends.

**Technologies:** React, SASS
